#### Go back to a specific commit

This command will create a commit and go back to specific commit. Yes, this method will leave the records instead of delete it completely from repo. However, this method is a lot **safer** than `git reset`, especially you're working with other people.

```
git revert <<commit_hash>>
```

#### Squash X commits into 1

This command will let you go back X commits by resetting git index to before the commits you want to squash. Use `--soft` so that git only resets the index and doesn't touch your working directory. Then create a commit as usual. [source from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50302458/10868150)

```
git reset --soft HEAD~<<X>> // go back X commits
git add --all // Add the changes
git commit 
git push --force 
```
